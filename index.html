            <h2>About me</h2>

            <p>
                Howdy! I am a 4th year senior computer science student at Texas A&M University. In addition to majoring in computer science, I am getting a minor in math and a minor in game design and development.

            <h2>My story with accessibility</h2>

            <p>
                I first came across the idea of accessibility by watching Mark Brown's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc38fcMFcV_vvWOhMDriBlVocTZ8mKQzR">Designing for Disability</a> video series on his YouTube channel, Game Maker's Toolkit. In that series he talked about how video games can accommodate different disabilities players might have, divided into four categories: hearing disabilities, visual disabilities, motor disabilities, and cognitive disabilities. Each video talked in depth about different disabilities in one of the categories, and how to design games in a way that accomodates those people.
            </p>

            <p>
                The part of these videos that was most memorable to me is his opening statment in each of them: "Video games are for everyone." The whole goal of accessibility in games is making it so everyone can experience the game. People with disabilities have barriers that prevent them from experiencing the game in the way other players can, so designers need to take their needs into account.
            </p>

            <p>
                As I thought more about accessibility, I realized all of these ideas can be applied to more than just video games. Websites and apps can be made accessible, as well as physical products people use everyday, to even buildings. If you make something that other people use directly, you need to think about how to make it accessibile.
            </p>

            <p>
                So far, the only course I have taken at A&M related to accessibility is CSCE 315, Programming Studio. We briefly talked about accessibility for websites. This semester I am taking CSCE 436, Human Computer Interaction. I hope to learn more about accessibility and how to better design software that works for everyone, so that I can make whatever I create in the future more accessibile.
